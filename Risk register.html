        <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In a previous activity from the Google Cybersecurity course on Coursera, I practiced performing a risk assessment by evaluating common vulnerabilities that threaten business operations. I then prioritized my resources based on the risk scores I assigned to each vulnerability. The purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks, and assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned. By completing this activity, I gained a deeper understanding of how risk assessments can help prevent cyberattacks and protect sensitive information.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Scenario</h2>
        <p>
            You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks. A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Operational Environment</h2>
        <p>
            The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's data‚Äî100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

                    <td colspan="6" class="notes">
                        Given the bank's specific context, the most likely causes of a supply chain disruption are cyberattacks targeting employees through business email compromise (BEC) and data breaches resulting from the bank's publicly accessible database. These scenarios pose a higher risk than a natural disaster like a hurricane, which, while possible, is less frequent in the area. Additionally, the low crime rate suggests that theft is a less significant concern compared to BEC and data breaches.
